# MonthlyBudgetCalc
This calculator is made as an experiement to better understand C# concepts that I learnt in Task P4 Control Flow.

The language is C#. You will need to have System.Convert and SplashKitSDK in order to run this program. The program was created via MSYS MINGW64 terminal with .NET installed.

This program has many bugs such as: Not being able to enter a wrong value for some entries, pressing enter twice will result in the program crashing + more I havent discovered. 

The program was designed with a recommended investment feature in mind, which hasn't been completed yet. The calculations are based off of monthly expenses and income, and the expenses are only limited to utilities, rent, and credit repayments, with no option to enter irregular expenses (car service, emergency spending etc). However, there is a recommended savings addition feature added; the user picks a savings goal from Maximum saving to Minimal savings, and based off of that selection, the program will reccomend you save different amounts of money. The program also has a feature to select which account (Debit or Savings) you want to deduct your bills from.
